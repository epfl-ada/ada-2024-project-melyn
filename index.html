        <div class="text">
            <p><span class="grey-italic">Challenge:</span></p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the prestigious École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 
                nestled in the serene Swiss city of Lausanne, five students shared an unlikely passion: cinema. Although they were 
                studying engineering and science, <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span>, <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span>,
                <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span>, <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span>, and 
                <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> found solace in their ADA course, led by the eccentric Professor Greenwood, a woman known 
                for her unorthodox teaching methods. One late afternoon, as sunlight streamed through the large glass windows of the Rolex Learning Center,
                Professor Greenwood gave her class an extraordinary challenge: “Your final project is to explore the evolution of cinema from 1915 to 2015.
                But don’t just present it make it extraordinary. Surprise me.”
            </p>

            


            <p><span class="grey-italic"><br>Brainstorming:</span></p>

            <img src="assets/img/group_travel.png" width="500" height="400" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

            <p>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span>, a passionate cinephile, who proposed an audacious idea during their brainstorming session.<br><br>
             -  “What if,” she said, her voice brimming with excitement, “we didn’t just study the history of cinema… but lived it?” <br><br>

              The others exchanged skeptical glances, except for <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span>, the group’s tech guru and inventor. His eyes narrowed as he leaned forward. <br><br>
 
            - “Actually…” he began, “that might not be as crazy as it sounds.” <br><br>

            <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> explained that he had been working in secret on a groundbreaking project in one of the university’s lesser known labs. 
               His invention, called the ChronoPorteur, was an experimental device capable of manipulating spacetime. Initially intended for
              simulating historical scientific phenomena, he believed it could be modified to allow actual travel through time.  <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span>, the skeptic of the group, raised an eyebrow. “Wait, you’re saying we could actually go back in time?”  <br><br>

            -“Theoretically, yes,” <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> replied. “But there’s a catch. If we interfere with historical events,
            we could alter the timeline in ways we can’t predict.”  <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span>, the group’s blockbuster enthusiast and eternal optimist, grinned. “So? Imagine standing on set with Chaplin, or watching Godard debate Truffaut, or even visiting Spielberg during Jaws! This could be legendary.” <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span>, the cautious and pragmatic one, folded his arms. “And if something goes wrong? What if we can’t come back?”  <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> hesitated for a moment but then said, “I’ve run the simulations. As long as we follow the rules observe but don’t 
            interfere we’ll be fine. Besides, it’s not like we’re rewriting history, just gathering data.” <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> didn’t look convinced. “Gathering data? Are you sure we can even extract meaningful insights from this? 
            Cinema isn’t just about what’s on the screen. Success depends on too many variables audience tastes, marketing, global trends.
             You really think we’ll make sense of it all?” <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> leaned forward, his voice confident. “That’s the beauty of it. We’ll see the patterns in real time what genres resonated, 
             how technology shaped storytelling, how filmmakers adapted to cultural shifts. Experiencing it firsthand will bring it to life.” <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> crossed his arms. “But technology doesn’t make a great movie. What about emotion? Storytelling? Can your ‘patterns’ 
            explain why Citizen Kane is a masterpiece or why Pulp Fiction became a cultural icon?”<br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> chimed in, her voice steady. “That’s why we’re doing this to see how creativity and innovation intersect.
             Yes, cinema is emotional, but trends and choices also shape its trajectory. This project isn’t about reducing cinema to numbers;
              it’s about understanding how those numbers reflect the world around them.” <br><br>

              - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> raised another question, still unconvinced. “And localization? What about international markets? 
              Are we saying success is only measured by Hollywood standards? What about films that thrived because they stayed 
              culturally authentic?”<br><br>

            - “Exactly!” <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> interjected. “We’re not just sticking to Hollywood. We’ll explore how other markets evolved Bollywood, 
            Japanese cinema, Italian Neorealism. Localization and globalization both matter, we will surely discover how they influenced success.”<br><br>

            - After a moment of silence, <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> finally sighed, a reluctant smile on his face. “Alright, fine. If this works, it’ll be incredible.
             But I’m holding you responsible if we end up stuck in 1915.”<br><br>

             - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> grinned mischievously. “Don’t worry, Lucas. If you get stuck in 1915, we’ll send you a telegram with instructions on how
              to invent the Internet and become the richest man alive. Just make sure you avoid eating anything suspiciously old timey, like 
              canned meat from a trench ration.”<br><br>

            - The group burst out laughing, and even <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> couldn’t help but crack a smile. “Great, now I’m picturing myself in a bowler hat 
            trying to explain Wi-Fi to Edison.” <br><br>

            - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> winked. “Hey, at least you’d be a trendsetter. The first guy to binge watch Netflix in an era where movies didn’t even have sound!” <br><br>

            - The group laughed, and <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> leaned in. “If we don’t take risks, we’ll never create something groundbreaking. Isn’t that what 
            cinema teaches us to dream big?”<br><br>

            After days of debate, the group made their decision. They would use Elyes’ ChronoPorteur to travel to five pivotal moments in the
            history of cinema. They spent a week fine tuning the machine, adjusting its parameters to minimize risks.”<br><br>

            As they finalized their plans, <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> had another idea : “What if,” he suggested, “instead of traveling together, we each explore one of the five eras? It would save time and allow us to focus deeply on each period.”<br><br>


          - <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> immediately claimed Silent Era (1915–1930) , eager to witness the birth of cinema<br>
          - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> jumped at the chance to explore The Golden Age (1930–1950) , excited to see the rise of Hollywood’s grandeur<br>
          - <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span>, intrigued by creative rebellion, chose Auteur Rise (1950–1970) <br>
          - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span>, fascinated by technological leaps, wanted to dive into Blockbusters (1970–2000)<br>
          - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span>, ever practical, took Diversity (2000–2015) , curious to analyze the data driven transformations of modern filmmaking<br> <br>

          - “Alright,” Elyes said, a mix of excitement and nerves in his voice. “Five eras, five explorers. 
          We’ll regroup once we’ve gathered enough data to tell the story of cinema’s evolution. Let’s make history ”<br> <br>

          - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span>, always the enthusiastic partner in Elyes’ wildest ideas, grinned and added, “History is made by those who dare to live it. So, let’s go live it.” <br> <br>

          With a final review of their plan, the group stepped up to the ChronoPorteur, ready to leap into their individual journeys through time.

                <p><span class="grey-italic"><br>The Homecoming: <br> </span></p>

                <p> Later, the ChronoPorteur hummed as the group returned to the lab, each carrying data from their era. <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> smiled, holding her notes on the Silent Era. <br><br>

                - “We’ve got everything : genres, runtimes, audience insights.”<br><br>

                - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> nodded. “From blockbusters to auteurs, it’s all here.”<br><br>

                - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> looked at the piles of data and grinned. “Now, let’s analyze it and tell the story of cinema’s evolution.”

    <h2 class="centered-heading-Title">Chapter 1: The Silent Era</h2>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group sat around a bright, modern table at the Rolex Learning Center, its open, airy design buzzing quietly with the
        energy of collaboration and curiosity. The ChronoPorteur rested in the center of the table, humming softly, a testament to
        Elyes’ daring ingenuity. Myriam, the first to return from her journey, looked radiant with excitement. <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span>, happy with his invention, asked, "How was it?"<br><br>

        <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> smiled. “It was magical. Silent films ruled, telling stories through visuals and music. Chaplin made us laugh,
        Metropolis made us think, and filmmakers everywhere were innovating. However, everything changed in 1927 with The Jazz Singer,
        the first major ‘talkie.’ It completely transformed the industry...”<br><br>
    
        - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> : “Wait, you’re saying that one film changed everything? Was it really that sudden?”<br><br>

        <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> gestured toward the plot on the screen, her voice filled with excitement. “Look at this,” she said, 
        pointing to the sharp rise of silent films through the 1910s and 1920s. “For most of this period, silent films completely ruled the industry, 
        telling stories through visuals and music. But everything changed in 1927 with The Jazz Singer. You can see here,” she said, tracing 
        the sudden drop, “how the introduction of sound transformed cinema. By 1928, Hollywood had fully converted to sound, and silent films 
        practically disappeared overnight. It was the end of an era, but also the beginning of a new one that redefined storytelling forever.”
        </p>

      <iframe src="plots/timeline_plot.html" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        - <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> : “Okay, but what about filmmakers outside Hollywood? 
        Were they affected in the same way, or was this a uniquely American shift?” <br><br>

        <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> paused, letting the significance of the plot sink in before continuing. “But it wasn’t just Hollywood adapting to this monumental 
        shift,” she said, her tone thoughtful. “Around the world, filmmakers were pushing boundaries in ways that redefined cinema as an art form.
        The World Cinema genre thrived during this period, not just because of the rise of talkies, but because of groundbreaking innovations and
        bold storytelling. Unique cinematic styles emerged, that challenged conventions and transformed how stories were told on screen.” <br><br>
        
       -  <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> : “Wait, wait, hold on. Are you saying these international films were actually better 
       than Hollywood’s? Can the data back that up?” <br><br>

       <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> smiled and pointed to the second plot now displayed on the screen. “And here’s something fascinating,” she said, gesturing to 
      the bar chart. “Among the top 10 genres of this era, World Cinema stands out with the highest average ratings. It wasn’t just about technical 
      innovations it was about storytelling that resonated deeply with audiences. Films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari or Metropolis pushed 
      creative boundaries, delivering bold, innovative narratives that captured the imagination of viewers around the globe. This genre was a 
      testament to how cinema was evolving into a universal language, even as sound began to reshape the industry.”

      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/ratings_comparison_chapter1.html" width="800" height="400" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        She paused, then added, “However, the late 1920s marked the beginning of something new. The rise of talkies didn’t just transform Hollywood it also sparked the emergence of unique cinematic movements 
        around the world, like German Expressionism. Each country began to develop its own film identity, producing movies in their native languages. But during this time, globalization was minimal there were 
        hardly any translations, and films largely stayed within their own borders.”<br><br>
        
        She leaned back, considering the data. “Because silent films dominated most of this era, language isn’t really an interesting
         feature to study it’s mostly irrelevant before talkies. And even after their emergence, language essentially mirrors country of origin,
         since each nation produced films in its own language with little international exchange.”<br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> :  “So the Silent Era wasn’t just about being silent it was about making noise without words.”<br><br>

        <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> chuckled. “Exactly. Silence spoke louder than anything, and its echoes still shape cinema today.”

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group continued their discussion, energized by Myriam’s passionate retelling of the Silent Era. Elyes turned to Yassine, curiosity in his voice. <br> <br>
        - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span>: "So, Yassine, what made the Golden Age so groundbreaking? Was it just about sound and color?" <br> <br>
        <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> pointed to the first chart, illustrating Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' extraordinary success. 
        "In 1937, this film already dominated with $416 million in global revenue, a record at the time. When adjusted for inflation to 2015,
         its gross skyrockets to $6.85 billion, making it the most financially successful film in history. This exemplifies how Hollywood’s 
         streamlined, genre focused studio system maximized cultural and financial impact during the Golden Age." <br>
        </p>

      <iframe src="plots/revenue_record_chapter2.html" width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        He then turned to the second plot, showing two sharp declines between 1910–1930 and 1930–1950: the average number of genres and languages
         per movie. "Silent films, relying on intertitles, were easily adapted for global audiences, averaging 1.55 languages per movie. With 
         the advent of sound, this dropped to 1.06, as spoken dialogue required expensive dubbing, subtitling, or reshooting. At the same time,
         silent films often blended 4.4 genres, combining drama, romance, and adventure. Between 1930 and 1950, this fell to 3.8 genres per film
         as major studios, like MGM and Warner Bros., specialized in single genre productions to streamline costs and meet the restrictions of
         the Hays Code. While these shifts reduced diversity, they enabled the rise of iconic films tailored to specific audiences, like musicals,
         gangster films, and war dramas".

      <iframe src="plots/film_genres_languages_chapter2.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
      - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span>: "How did the Great Depression and World War II shape the kinds of stories told during this period?"<br><br>

      “Greatly,” <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> replied, gesturing to a chart on the screen. “During the Depression, cinema became a vital escape.
       Affordable tickets and uplifting musicals, like Top Hat, gave people a break from harsh realities. When World War II began, 
       cinema shifted gears, becoming both entertainment and propaganda. Films like Casablanca inspired patriotism while addressing 
       themes of sacrifice and unity. Studios collaborated with governments to create warthemed content that kept audiences engaged 
       and informed, giving people hope during turbulent times”. 
      </p>

       <iframe src="plots/theme_evolution_chapter2.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
      - <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span>: "Was Hollywood the only key player, or did other countries make their mark?" <br> <br>

      "Hollywood's dominance in global cinema production is unmistakable," <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> remarked, pointing to the plot showing movie production data 
      from 1930 to 1950. "As we can see, the United States consistently produced over 80% of all films during this period. The scale of Hollywood's
      output dwarfs other countries, with the United Kingdom trailing far behind, contributing just over 8%. Japan stands at around 1%, while France 
      and Italy are closer to 2%, making up the rest of the top five. This overwhelming dominance of Hollywood shaped global film culture, but at the 
      same time, movements like Italian Neorealism and directors like Akira Kurosawa in Japan began to break new ground. Italian Neorealism, with 
      films like Bicycle Thieves, offered raw, emotional storytelling rooted in the struggles of post war Italy. Meanwhile, Kurosawa’s films blended 
      cultural specificity with universal themes, setting the stage for Japan's eventual global recognition in cinema." <br> <br>
      </p>

    <iframe src="plots/film_production_chapter2.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> leaned back, his voice confident. “The Golden Age was about innovation, resilience, and storytelling that 
        united people across the globe. It wasn’t just an era of technical progress, it was cinema’s emotional and cultural awakening”.

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group shifted their attention to Najmeddine, eager to hear about his journey through 
        the transformative period of 1950–1970. <br> <br>

        As the group continued their discussion, <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> paused to take a sip of tea before pointing at a new plot he had brought back. 
        "One of the most striking findings from my time in the 1950-1970 period was the growth of international collaborations in filmmaking", 
        he began, gesturing toward a vibrant Sankey plot projected on the screen. "This chart illustrates the partnerships between countries
        during that era. For instance, the United States and the United Kingdom frequently collaborated, their shared language and cultural
         proximity making it easier to coproduce films. Meanwhile, France and Italy, both at the heart of post war European cinema, 
        had a strong connection too. They worked together to bring us some of the most artistically rich and critically acclaimed films 
        of the time". <br> <br>

        He leaned forward, pointing out the thicker lines on the chart. 
        "These lines represent the number of coproductions between pairs of countries. You can see how nations like Japan began 
        forming smaller, but significant, collaborations with Western countries as their cinema gained global recognition. 
        The data revealed how films became a bridge for cultural exchange, blending styles and narratives from across the world. 
        It was a pivotal moment when cinema truly became a global art form".
      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/films_collaborations_chapter3.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>
     
      <p>
      - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> nodded, intrigued by the analysis. "And what drove these collaborations?" he asked. <br> <br>

      <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> replied, "Several factors. The aftermath of World War II brought a wave of reconstruction, and governments saw 
      cinema as both a cultural tool and an economic opportunity. Coproductions allowed them to share costs, access broader markets, 
      and fuse diverse storytelling techniques. It was as much about survival as it was about creativity. It reflects the growing 
      interconnectedness of the world itself during that era". <br><br> 

      - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span>, ever curious, asked, “And Hollywood? Was it still dominant in genres like action and drama?”<br><br> 

      <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> nodded. “Yes, Hollywood’s output was still massive, but global cinema brought nuance. Look at this scatter plot.”
      He brought up a visualization showing genre diversity by country. “In Hollywood, action and drama dominated, but other countries 
      explored unique blends. Japan, for instance, married samurai epics with psychological themes, thanks to Kurosawa.
       In France, crime films became introspective and philosophical, breaking genre conventions.”
      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/genre_by_country_chapter3.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

    <p>
      - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> chimed in, “What about languages? Were films still confined to their home audiences?” <br><br>

      <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> smiled, holding up a line graph. “This shows the rise in multilingual films from 1950 to 1970. 
      You see that upward trend? European filmmakers began creating bilingual or trilingual productions, especially during the 
      ‘60s. It wasn’t just commercial it reflected a world becoming more interconnected post war. Festivals like Cannes celebrated these 
      films, giving them global exposure.” 
    </p>
    <iframe src="plots/rise_of_languages_chapter3.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

    <p>
      - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> leaned in with the final question. “And how did all these shifts feel to you? What did the data tell you about this period overall?” <br><br>

      <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> paused, his expression thoughtful. “The data told a story of cinematic democratization. Hollywood was still huge, 
      but other countries began shaping the narrative. It wasn’t just about scale anymore it was about creativity. Films became mirrors of 
      their societies, grappling with post war recovery, existential questions, and cultural identity. The rise of new movements, 
      hybrid genres, and multilingual storytelling all of it pointed to a cinema that was more personal, more global, and more reflective of 
      the world’s complexity.” <br> <br>

      He gestured at his final chart a comparison of global genre experimentation. “This period marked a shift from cinema as entertainment 
      to cinema as art. The numbers were clear, but watching films like Breathless and Seven Samurai firsthand made me realize how deeply this 
      change resonated.” 
    </p>

    <iframe src="plots/genre_diversification_per_year_chapter3.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

    <p>
      The group nodded, captivated by <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine's</span> story. “This era wasn’t just a shift,” he concluded. “It was a revolution.
      Directors were no longer just making movies, they were making art, statements, and history.”

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group turned to Elyes, who had explored the blockbuster dominated
        era of 1970–2000. <br> <br>

        <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> looks around the table and smiles. "Alright, let's talk about the 1970-2000 period, a time when cinema really evolved on a
         global scale. The question I spent a lot of time thinking about was: how did hybrid genres come to dominate? And did they shape 
         the future of cinema as we know it today?" <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> leans forward, intrigued. "That’s an interesting question. So, what did you find?" <br> <br>

        <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> nods. "Well, hybrid genres weren’t just a passing trend, they became a key strategy for Hollywood. Let’s look at a plot 
        showing Hybrid Genre Evolution over time." He pulls up a detailed graph displaying the rise of hybrid genres, particularly through 
        the 1980s and 1990s.
      
      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/genres_heatmap_chapter4.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>
      <iframe src="plots/genre_network_chapter4.html" width="900" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        "Here’s what we see," <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> continues, "In the 1970s, genres like westerns, dramas, and thrillers were still dominant. 
        But in the 1980s, you begin to see a shift.” He points to the chart. “ Action movies were on the rise, and they started mixing with comedy, 
        like in Ghostbusters (1984). Then by the '90s, it was even more pronounced films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), combining action 
        and sci-fi, or Men in Black (1997), blending comedy with sci-fi." <br><br>

        He continues. "What’s particularly fascinating is that hybrid genres were not just creative; they were a smart marketing tool. 
        A comedy-action movie could attract fans from two separate groups, making it more likely to succeed. These hybrids were designed to be globally appealing." <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> raises an eyebrow. "But did these hybrids perform better internationally? Did they cross borders in ways other genres didn’t?"<br><br>

        <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> smiles at the question. "Great point. Here, I’ve got a Global Box Office Map with Genre Overlays that shows exactly
        how hybrid genres performed across different markets." He brings up a heatmap overlaying box office revenue by region and genre.

      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/box_office_per_genre_country_chapter4.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        "As you can see, action films were huge in the U.S. and Europe, but hybrids like action-comedy or sci-fi-action had a massive impact in Asia,
         particularly Japan and China. Sci-fi-action, like Star Wars and The Matrix, became almost a global phenomenon. Sci-fi films, which 
         traditionally had niche followings, took off globally because they combined spectacle with mainstream action tropes." <br> <br>

         - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span>, always interested in the business side, asks, "But how did hybrid genres impact box office revenue? Was this just a 
         creative shift, or was there a real financial strategy behind it?" <br><br>

         <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span>, now pulling up the Genre Box Office Revenue Distribution plot, responds. "This chart answers that question. 
         It shows the revenue distribution across different genres from the '70s to the 2000s. As you can see, action films had consistently high 
         earnings, but hybrid genres like sci-fi-action or comedy-action often outperformed single genre films." <br><br>

        He zooms in on the 1990s. "Look at the massive spike in revenue for these hybrid genres. The Matrix (1999), a combination of sci-fi
        and action, grossed over $450 million worldwide, making it one of the highest grossing films of its time. Similarly, Men in Black earned
        over $580 million globally, even though its core genre was comedy. The key takeaway is that combining genres expanded the potential audience
        for these films, which drove up box office numbers." <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> leans back in his chair, thoughtfully. "It seems like hybrid genres were more than just a passing trend.
        They were part of a bigger picture Hollywood becoming a global force." <br><br>

        "Absolutely," <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> concludes, nodding in agreement. "And looking at these patterns, it’s clear how Hollywood used hybrids to reach
        beyond the American audience and tap into international markets. It was the dawn of the global blockbuster." <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> pauses for a moment, 
        then adds, "Another major shift during this era was the rise of seasonal releases, particularly in the summer. The 1970s marked the 
        beginning of the summer blockbuster phenomenon, with films like Jaws (1975) and Star Wars (1977) dominating the box office. Studios started
        strategically timing big budget releases for the summer months, capitalizing on the season’s higher movie going traffic. This created a
        cycle where summer releases would generate huge global buzz, with sequels or similar blockbuster films following suit in the coming years.
        This trend not only changed how movies were marketed but also solidified summer as the prime season for global cinema events." <br> <br>

       - <span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span>: "Lucas, after all the changes Elyes talked about, how did the digital era really change cinema between 2000 and 2015? 
       Was there a significant shift in how movies were made, or was it more about distribution?" <br><br>

       <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> smiles, adjusting his seat, ready to begin his tale : "Thanks, Myriam. Well, in those 15 years, we saw the digital revolution 
      reshape everything. The rise of digital filmmaking tools made production cheaper and more accessible, leading to a wave of new filmmakers
      and more diverse stories. But the most significant change came in how films were distributed. The rise of streaming platforms like Netflix,
      Amazon Prime, and Hulu made it possible for movies to reach global audiences without going through traditional theatrical distribution.
      This period marked the start of the Digital Era, where films no longer needed to wait for a theater run to achieve international success.
      Suddenly, films from all corners of the world could be viewed globally, and the number of movies exploded" <br><br>

      <p>
        Yassine leans forward, eager to ask his question. <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span>: "That's fascinating, Lucas. But what about the types of movies? Did you see any notable changes in genres or trends in this period,
         especially in terms of hybrid genres? How did those genres impact the global box office?" <br><br>

         <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> nods, picking up his tablet to show a graph. <br><br>

         "Great question, Yassine. The hybrid genre explosion really took off in this period. Genres started blending in new and creative ways.
          Action, sci-fi, and fantasy mixed with adventure, drama, and even horror. Think about films like Avatar(2009), which mixed sci-fi with 
          epic adventure and groundbreaking visual effects. Then there was The Hunger Games(2012), combining sci-fi, action, and drama in a way that
          resonated with both young and adult audiences alike. What’s remarkable is how these hybrids performed globally. The global box office map
          from this era shows that action and sci-fi films, in particular, performed well across international markets. It was no longer just 
          Hollywood films doing well in the U.S.; countries like China and India became major players in the market, with films like Transformers 
          (2007) and Avatar doing huge numbers worldwide."
      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/hybrid_genres_chapter5.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        Najmeddine, sitting across from Lucas, chimes in with his question. <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span>: "You’ve mentioned globalization and international films. Did this era see an increase in international 
        coproductions? How did these films perform globally compared to their Hollywood counterparts?" <br><br>

        <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> grins, excited to tackle the question : "Absolutely, Najmeddine. The early 2000s saw a dramatic increase in international
         coproductions, particularly between Hollywood and Asian countries like China and South Korea. Films like The Great Wall (2016),
          though slightly outside the timeframe, represent the trend where large Hollywood studios would partner with international studios to
           ensure global appeal. South Korean films, such as Oldboy (2003), gained massive international popularity and influenced Hollywood, even
            inspiring remakes. What’s truly exciting is the genre overlay across countries. As we saw in the Genre Box Office Revenue Distribution, 
            action, fantasy, and even horror films from South Korea, India, and China saw a significant rise in international box office revenue. 
            The landscape was no longer dominated by just Hollywood; the world had truly become a cinematic stage, and local films gained global 
            recognition." <br> <br>

      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/genre_box_office_chapter5.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>
      <p>
        "Another one of the key changes during 2000-2015 was the rise in diversity, particularly in terms of gender and age among actors. 
        Previously, action films were dominated by male leads in their prime years, but this era saw a shift. Female leads became more common
         in blockbuster films, and the inclusion of actors from diverse ethnic backgrounds grew, especially in global franchises like 
         Fast and Furious."

      </p>

      <iframe src="plots/diversity_chapter5.html" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></iframe>

      <p>
        Age also became less of a barrier. Older actors, like Liam Neeson in Taken, proved that action heroes could be from any age group.
        This shift in casting reflected a broader cultural movement toward more inclusive and representative storytelling in cinema." <br><br>

        Lucas finishes his story, the data on hybrid genres, globalization, international films and diversity painting a vivid picture of a transformative period. <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span>: "That's an incredible overview, Lucas. It’s fascinating how the digital era and globalization made cinema more diverse and accessible worldwide." <br><br>
        
        Lucas nods with a smile, his eyes reflecting a deeper understanding of the data he gathered over his journey through the 2000-2015 era.

        The group sat back around the table, the ChronoPorteur now silent after their extraordinary journeys through the history of cinema. 
        They exchanged glances, a mix of satisfaction and exhaustion on their faces. It was <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> who broke the silence. <br><br>

        - “Well,” he said, leaning back in his chair, “we’ve gathered data, crunched numbers, and lived through a century of cinema. 
        So, can we predict the next Titanic or Star Wars?”  <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> smirked. “If we could, we’d already be pitching it to Hollywood and making billions. But let’s face it, success in 
        cinema has always been unpredictable. It’s as much about context as it is about content.”<br><br>

        -<span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span> nodded, her cinephile spirit undeterred. “Exactly. Look at the classics. Many of them aren’t remembered because they followed some
         formula, but because they captured something unique about their time or influenced everything that came after. Metropolis, The Jazz Singer,
         Star Wars… they were groundbreaking for their eras, not because anyone predicted their impact.”<br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #877fec;">Yassine</span> grinned. “Yeah, and let’s not forget that Citizen Kane wasn’t even a box office hit when it came out. Now it’s a 
        ‘masterpiece.’ So much for objective criteria.”<br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #72d9ff;">Najmeddine</span> added, “It’s like chasing shadows. Maybe we could come up with a list of features that guarantee success today, 
        but by tomorrow, some viral trend or global event would flip the script entirely.”<br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> raised an eyebrow. “So what you’re saying is… predicting success is impossible?” <br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> leaned forward, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. “Not impossible, just pointless. 
        Cinema isn’t about predicting what works. It’s about experimenting, taking risks, and capturing the spirit of the moment. 
        The second you think you’ve figured out the formula, the world will surprise you.” <br><br>

        -<span style="color:  #76c8ff;">Myriam</span>  smiled. “And isn’t that what makes cinema magical? The unexpected hits, the sleeper successes, the films that resonate 
        decades later for reasons no one could have imagined?”<br><br>

        - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> chuckled. “Alright, fine. We can’t predict the next blockbuster. But at least we know one thing for sure.”<br><br>

        - “What’s that?” <span style="color:  #6a8bd9;">Elyes</span> asked, raising an eyebrow.<br><br>
        - <span style="color:  #3498db;">Lucas</span> grinned. “If it involves time travel and a bunch of nerds, it’s bound to be a hit someday.”<br><br>
        - The group erupted in laughter, their project complete but the love for cinema and its mysteries stronger than ever.
