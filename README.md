# Abstract :
This project analyzes the key factors influencing box-office success for films released between 1914 and 2016, seeking to understand how audience preferences and industry trends have evolved over time. We focus on a variety of characteristics—such as genre, release timing, localization (number of translations), and lead actors' age and gender—to determine their impact on a film's revenue. By examining six distinct historical periods, we aim to uncover how shifts in these characteristics correlate with box-office performance. Additionally, we explore genre combinations and actor age pairings to see if certain patterns consistently align with higher revenue. We also assess how localization strategies, like translations into specific languages, have helped films reach a wider audience. This study provides a comprehensive view of the changing dynamics of film success, revealing patterns that reflect both cinematic trends and evolving audience preferences across decades

# Research Questions : 
- Does the release season of a film influence its commercial success ?
- Were there specific 20-year periods where a film's genre/theme (historical, sci-fi, romantic comedy, etc.) was the predominant factor driving its commercial success
- What age range of actors (e.g. 20s, 30s, 40s+) has tended to yield the highest box office numbers in different time periods ?
- How have the highest-grossing films' box office numbers evolved from the inception of cinema until 2016? Can we identify clear inflection points?
- Are there genres that have maintained consistent commercial appeal across most time periods ?
- Does releasing a film with more foreign language translations associate with higher worldwide box office revenue?
- To what extent does offering more foreign language translations for a film contribute to increased global box office earnings?
- Are younger actors more popular than older ones ? Is it the complete opposite? Does it vary across the years ? Does it differ depending on the genre ?
